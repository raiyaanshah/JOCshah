    <h1>So, photography!</h1>
    <p class="p">It's not a thing I take incredibly seriously but it's still great fun! I just like taking simple photos and doing a bit (well, more than a bit) of editing here and there. Do I like it because it's something i enjoy doing or do I like it because of how easy it is? It's a little bit of both...



    Nope, just because it's easy. I do like photography though. One of my favorite little pastimes.</p>
    <img src="flowers.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
    <p>Some flowers in our backyard. Didn't feel like dealing with the big wheel thing so I left it at our little stalemate.</p>
        <img src="lantern.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
        <p>Just a little lantern I saw when I was at Yotam's house. I thought it looked nice so I took a quick picture.</p>
            <img src="mountains.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
            <p>I took a couple of photos on the plane from a trip not too long ago. This is one of them.</p>
                <img src="plane.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                <p>This is another photo from the same flight. A lot of nice scenery of the mountains here.</p>
                    <img src="summer.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                    <p>This one I took in the car when we went on a small little drive last summer. I got a jacket on that trip. Nice jacket it is.</p>
                        <img src="waves.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                        <p>This one actually came from a close up video my sister took while we were at the beach during ski week (strange place to go during february, i know). I paused the video on this frame and I thought it looked cool so I screenshotted it, edited it, and got this.</p>
                          <img src="album.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                          <p>Above is the current cover art for the album I've been working on since April 8th of 2021. I've rotated between several different ones but this is the one I'm sticking with for now</p>
                            <img src="backyard.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                            <p>This is just a simple picture of one of the flowers in my backyard</p>
                              <img src="clusteredflowers.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                              <p>A bit of a contrast, this is a picture of one of the flowers in the front of the house</p>
                                  <img src="bushflowers.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                  <p>This one too</p>
                                    <img src="driveway.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                    <p>This too...</p>
                                      <img src="crossedflowers.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                      <p>I've milked my yard for flower pictures</p>
                                          <img src="skyflowers.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                          <p>Like i said...</p>
                                              <img src="streetlight.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                              <p>Finally something different, this one is one of the lamps in front of the school</p>
                                                  <img src="gate.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                  <p>This is a picture of the gate at my house. Probably my favorite part of the whole house just because of the plants back there.</p>
                                                      <img src="biggerplants.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                      <p>This picture I took on the trip that the plane and mountain pictures came from earlier</p>
                                                          <img src="cloudview.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                          <p>Yet another picture from that same flight</p>
                                                              <img src="dunes.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                              <p>While this looks like a scene from some alien desert planet, it's a lamp from a resteraunt that had a napkin over it. That's it. That's the picture</p>
                                                                  <img src="ice.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                                  <p>A bunch of ice had frozen in a sort of small tower off of the roof of my brother's friends' tahoe house thing</p>
                                                                      <img src="mountainview.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
                                                                      <p>ANOTHER picture from that SAME FLIGHT</p>
                                                                          <img src="plants.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">

                                                                              <img src="sun.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">

                                                                                  <img src="cartwo.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">

I probably could've ordered the pictures better and in chronological order but I guess this is fine.</p>
                                                                                      <img src="clouds.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
