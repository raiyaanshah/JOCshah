    <h1>My Album (So far)</h1>
    <img src="album.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px">
    <p class="p">This was my first attempt at making an album! Still a very rough project (as you might tell if you listen) it's far from finished. The album cover I shot and edited myself during biology. Clearly the best way to spend all that valuable learning time. As for the music itself, the first track was the first song I made (shocker, i know) in between classes back in eighth grade and it was pretty fun to make. I did make several versions, but stuck with this one as it was the one that set the tone for the rest of the songs. The second song I made around the beginning of that summer. A minimalistic little tune with soft pianos and synthesizers, it was a song that I felt could follow up the first and give the listener an easy experience after an intro that went through as many stages as it did. The third track was made MONTHS later and this is where the chronological order of the tracks made doesn't link up with the order of the tracklist in the slightest. This song, while starting out with soft piano chords and ambience not dissimilar to the previous ones, cuts into some heavily processed drum samples to give it a heavier tone to switch up the mood a little bit. The fourth track almost features no percussion except for a short part in the middle and the wind chime esque sounds in the outro (if you really count those as percussion). Yet another switch up between the tracks, it's much more soft and relaxing than the track before with the heavy drums. Then, the mood changes almost entirely. With the interlude, dark strings and ambience sets the tone and deep percussion elements rush in to fill the gaps the strings can't. The drums, samples of Nina Simone's classic record See-Line Woman (one of my favorites from her, my favorite being strange fruit) are chopped to create a percussion line to compliment the strings. The sixth track coming right after the interlude is a slow rendition of Hymn of the Cherebium by Tchaikovsky, one of my favorite pieces by the composer. The same drums from before are used but sequenced differently because I wanted the two to sound like they're components of each other but not sound exactly the same. As for the seventh track, I wanted a much slower song to cool things down after the rush of sounds that the previous track was. A set of strings and (suprise suprise) even more slow soft pianos, it's a more gentle song with more melancholic chords than the previous two tracks that came before it. However, the next track brings the album back into interlude season. It's a song that starts off with more warm synthesizers and percussion and features none other than Andre 3000 on the flute! (incorporated just perfectly out of tune). He didn't actually play this FOR me of course, I just saw a video of him playing a wooden flute and thought it sounded cool (please don't be mad at me andre, i love your work). The track right after follows a similar structure as the one before with more warm synthesizers but more exotic percussion and even a hand pan! The hand pan was from a cover of the song Aria Math by C418 (the minecraft guy, you probably know him) who was actually one of if not the biggest inspiration for the sounds of this album. Finally at the end of the album is the second song I made for it. The song is just a simple piano piece I wrote back during the last week of eighth grade to ease my nerves in between the tests. A few months later, I was wondering how I wanted to end the album (even thought I hadn't even gotten close to finishing it) and so I came back to this song but thought it was missing something. A few days later my father came to me with a book by Carl Sagan called The Pale Blue Dot (see where i'm going with this?). I liked it a lot and so I looked for an audio book recording and I found not only a recording of Carl Sagan HIMSELF reading it out, but the exact part I wanted! So I put it all together as well as an orchestral outro which ties the outro in with the melodic elements of the first song. I've also been working on a few languages and two stories to go along with the album as well as an ARG to hide it all behind but that's all too unfinished to show to everyone (plus it'll ruin all the secrets i have saved behind it) so I'll leave that out for now. None of the album is finished and I'm still working on the tracks, order, and names of the songs (as well as the name of the actual album). I've attempted to embed an audio player into the website but it probably won't work so I guess you can just imagine what the songs sound like. If it does work though then that's fantastic!</p>
